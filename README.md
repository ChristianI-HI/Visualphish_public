# It Doesnâ€™t Look Like Anything to Me: Using Diffusion Model to Subvert Visual Phishing Detectors
The repository contains code and dataset samples to generate adversarial logos that subvert Visual Phishing Detectors (i.e., PhishIntention: https://github.com/lindsey98/PhishIntention). The attack method generates the adversarial logo that has a large perceptual distance from the original logo but with semantic-preserving changes. We show visual examples of adversarial logo images and webpage screenshots that bypass the state-of-the-art visual phishing detectors. Detailed instructions can be found under the text and image logo attack category. The repo also includes the user study we conducted which proved the effectiveness of our adversarial logos in fooling end users.
